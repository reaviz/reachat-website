## Markdown Plugins
reachat uses [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to parse and render markdown.
You can use the `remarkPlugins` prop to add custom plugins to the markdown parser.
Any plugin that is supported by remark should work here as well.

### Pre-packaged plugins
Out of the box, we provide a sample plugin but we plan to expand this later on.

- [CVE Plugin](https://github.com/reaviz/reachat/blob/master/src/Markdown/plugins/remarkCve.ts)

You can view the [Storybook Stories](https://storybook.reachat.dev) for more examples.

### Writing your own plugin

We will build a plugin that will identify and render CVE links. Below is a sample response:

```md
Please review the following CVEs:

- CVE-2021-34527
- CVE-2021-44228
- CVE-2021-45046
```

We can leverage the `remarkPlugins` prop to add custom plugins to the markdown parser. Below
is an example of the plugin code:

```ts
import { findAndReplace } from 'mdast-util-find-and-replace';

const CVE_REGEX = /(CVE-(19|20)\d{2}-\d{4,7})/gi;

export function remarkCve() {
  return (tree, _file) => {
    findAndReplace(tree, [[
      CVE_REGEX,
      replaceCve as unknown as any
    ]]);
  };

  function replaceCve(value, id) {
    return [
      {
        type: 'link',
        url: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=${id}`,
        children: [
          { children: [{ type: 'text', value: value.trim() }] }
        ]
      }
    ];
  }
}
```

After you integrate this into your app, the above markdown will render as follows:

```md
Please review the following CVEs:

- [CVE-2021-34527](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34527)
- [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)
- [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046)
```

To leverage our new plugin, we need to include it in the `remarkPlugins` prop.

```tsx
import { Chat } from 'reachat';
import { remarkCve } from 'PATH_YOU_SAVED_THE_PLUGIN';

export function App() {
  return (
    <Chat remarkPlugins={[remarkCve]}>
      ...rest of your code...
    </Chat>
  );
}
```
